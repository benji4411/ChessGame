# ChessGame
A simple chess game in C++ with a chess engine using the minimax algorithm.

This is one of my first personnal project, I made it starting from the Chili DirectX Framework from the Beginner C++ Game Programming Tutorial 0
which you can find more information about its creator and download it on this link https://wiki.planetchili.net/index.php/Beginner_C%2B%2B_Game_Programming_Tutorial_0.

The Framework provides a "ready to code" environment and very basic functions such as displaying pixels on the screen and getting mouse and keyboard input.


To test it

If you want to test my program, the best choice would be to open it on Visual Studio by clicking on Code then Open with Visual Studio or download the project and open the chess-game.sln in Visual Studio and build it yourself. But another way, if you trust me, is to use the executable file I put for you in ChessGame, note that you will probably be asked if you are sure to run an .exe on your computer, also, it is important to have the .wav sound files in the same folder as the engine.exe to make it work.
